# Homelessness in the USA (exam_py)

This project attempts to visualize the staggering and ever increasing numbers of homeless people in the US by looking at the state level. 

Three graphs depict different facets of the phenomenon:
1. Number of homeless individuals by state in descending order
2. Temperature fluctuations (average low temperatures) in the capitals of the states with highest, middle and least number of homeless people, to capture the human experience aspect of being homeless.
3. Political affiliation/voter registration in the states with the highest, middle and least number of homeless people, to showcase the political side of the situation. This is by no means an attempt to establish a causal relationship. However, there is no denying that political decisions have implications for the state of affairs in any given state or country.  


The dataset with statistics on homeless people by state is taken from a GitHub account providing different kinds of datasets for beginners to manipulate and play around with.
https://github.com/elmoallistair/datacamp/blob/master/data-manipulation-with-pandas/datasets/homelessness.csv 

The data on temperature (average low) is taken from the following websites, and manually added to the code:

Los Angeles, CA: https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/California/Places/los-angeles-temperatures-by-month-average.php 

Oklahoma City, OK:
https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Oklahoma/Places/oklahoma-city-temperatures-by-month-average.php 

Jackson, WY:
https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Wyoming/Places/jackson-temperatures-by-month-average.php 


The data on political affiliation is taken from these websites, and manually added to the code. For the sake of simplicity and ease of visualization, only three categories are visible in the graphs: Republican, Democratic and Other. The other category includes all other affiliations, e.g., Libertarian, No party preference, etc.

It is important to note that homelessness is a complex and multifactioral issue, and thus has no easy solutions, 

This work constitutes the exam project of the PSY-3035 Programming and Data Visualization course at UiT during Spring 2023.




## Usage/Examples
The code can be found in the scripts folder. Included are also png files showcasing what the graphs should look like.

## Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the support and guidance provided in the form of workshops occurring every Thursday afternoon by the professor of the course, Dr. James McCutcheon.

The project is made by me, but I would also like to acknowledge the help I have received from other classmates in the course as well as various Internet resources, and of course, the guy behind the GitHub account that provided the clean csv file with data.



## FAQ

#### Are the statistics in the dataset up to date?
On the Github account where I found the csv file containing the dataset, there is no reference to the origin of the data, so I can't verify the point in time these were accurate numbers. Although I did a quick check on the state population statistics in a few of the states, and current numbers do not deviate that much from current stats. So I am guessing the data is pretty recent.


#### What is the definition of homeless?
The definition of being homeless makes the phenomenon of homelessness elusive, as there are multiple ways of being homeless. The homeless individuals we encounter on the streets are merely a small fraction of the total number of people who do not have a place to call home. There are also people living in their cars, staying with friends and other types of temporary living conditions. Those individuals may not be considered homeless, making the issue even more complex and difficult to grasp the full extent of.
